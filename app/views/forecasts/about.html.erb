	<p>
		WeatherOutfits is just a simple fun web app built using ruby, some javascript/jQuery, HTML and CSS in the Ruby on Rails framework.
		You can use this web app to search for any location in the USA by its city or zipcode to get the current weather, hourly, 
		tomorrow and weekly forecast.  You can also make a comment or just shop from my closet on 
		<%= link_to "Poshmark", "https://poshmark.com/closet/cynth43" %> #laughoutloud!
	</p>
	<p>
		The ability to get your weather forecast is provided by using the 
		<%= link_to "weather underground API", "http://api.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?d=data/forecast&MR" %>. 
		<br>
		Building this Web App was a challenge - especially on the frontend side. Will improve the app. 
		It's still a work in progress.  I look forward to building more things in the future. 
		Motto: Always be learning and coding.
